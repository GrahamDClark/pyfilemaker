#The supercharging of FileMaker’s XML RPC continues...

= Introduction =

In several ways pyFileMaker is a sequell to FX.php, the binding between FX.php and FileMaker since Filemaker 5 through 9, written by Chris Hansen, Chris Adams and Gjermund Gusland Thorsen aka ggt667( Unicode and other conveniences ) The invention of FX.php was mainly to bring FileMaker to one of the most common web platforms; php but also a fight against the proprietary layer( or speed bump if you will ) named Lasso.

In spirit more than direct descendence is pyFileMaker taking this step further, by giving you the chance to bring your FileMaker data to any python scriptable environment there is; anywhere, our primary use so far has been mail robots, and parsers, but this will allow you to make custom iPhone apps in a python environment without having to relay on web interface; in the same fashion as stocks or weather.
