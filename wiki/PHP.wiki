#So far the FileMaker’s XML RPC has been very popular in the php environment...

= Prior art =

In several ways pyFileMaker is a sequell to FX.php, the binding between FX.php and FileMaker since Filemaker 5 through 9, written by Chris Hansen, Chris Adams and Gjermund Gusland Thorsen aka ggt667( Unicode and other conveniences ) The invention of FX.php was mainly to bring FileMaker to one of the most common web platforms; php but also a fight against the proprietary layer( or speed bump if you will ) named Lasso or Tango for that matter.


= Details =

There are several ways to interchange data with FileMaker’s XML RPC, here are the php ones:
  * FX.php
  * FileMaker and php
  * FileMaker API for PHP


= FX.php (Filemaker Xml parser class for php )=

Open Source approach to interchanging Filemaker data with the web
Good documentation, live hands on example
http://iviking.org/FX.php/

= FileMaker and php =

Open Source approach to interchanging Filemaker data with the web, derived from FX.php?
Main change AFAIK is that it comes with alot of documentation, in the form of sample queries in a PDF file, but it’s alot more than FX.php’s 7 pages or whatver, but is it needed? German or Austrian approach? I have not seen any updates to this one last 2 years.


= FileMaker API for PHP =

FileMaker’s own php approach to interchanging FileMaker data with the web, using objects instead of arrays,
but with preformatted templates for rapid web development.

Warning: In FileMaker API for PHP attempt has been done to cripple the code, and is not representative to the way the php developer community is behaving in general.
