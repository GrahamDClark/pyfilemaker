There are several ways to interchange data with FileMaker’s XML RPC, here are the php ones:
  * FX.php
  * FileMaker and php
  * FileMaker API for PHP


= FX.php (Filemaker Xml parser class for php )=

Open Source approach to interchanging Filemaker data with the web
Good documentation, live hands on example
http://iviking.org/FX.php/

= FileMaker and php =

Open Source approach to interchanging Filemaker data with the web, branch of FX.php?
Main change AFAIK is that it comes with alot of documentation, in the form of sample queries in a PDF file, but it’s alot more than FX.php’s 7 pages or whatver, but is it needed?


= FileMaker API for PHP =

FileMaker’s own php approach to interchanging FileMaker data with the web, using objects instead of arrays,
but with preformatted templates for rapid web development.
